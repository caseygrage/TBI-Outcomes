# TBI-Outcomes
Multilevel Discrete Time Survival Analysis of TBI Outcomes
Johns Hopkins Master of Science in Applied & Computational Mathematics Course: Mathematical Models for Healthcare 625.651

A retrospective study of Traumatic Brain Injury patients (dataset found in Kaggle) utilizing methods from Regression Methods in Biostatistics by Vittinghoff, et al. Chapters 6 through 9. Now this dataset is going to be interesting to perform survival analysis on because time is not a continuous variable, rather there are 3 discrete times: 洧노0 (patient is brought to the hospital, 洧노1 (3 months after TBI), 洧노2 (6-9 months after TBI). I will fit different models to the data to determine which factors determine change from entry diagnosis t0, midterm diagnosis 洧노1, and exit diagnosis 洧노2.
